# MSP430-G2553 Labs

A collection of programs I wrote in C and Assembly specifically for the MSP430-G2553 Dev board as part of an Intro to Microprocessors Class. 

This code was originally written with [TI Code Composer Studio IDE](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO).
For the C programming, [Energia IDE](https://energia.nu/download/) is a much more lightweight option I tested which will also flash the microcontroller.
