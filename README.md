# MSP430-G2553 Labs

A collection of programs I wrote in C and Assembly specifically for the MSP430-G2553 Dev board as part of an Intro to Microprocessors Class. 

This code was originally written with [TI Code Composer Studio IDE](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO).
For the C programming, [Energia IDE](https://energia.nu/download/) is a much more lightweight option I tested which will also flash the microcontroller.

### Notes:

The Assembly Code portion of this repo, when viewed in GitHub, shows very messy code formatting for some reason.
When the repo is downloaded and imported to VS Code and then viewed (I did this as a test), the formatting is proper.
So, sorry for the strange messy format, but just DL the code and it should show up with the correct format.
All the code written in C Language does not have this problem when viewed on GitHub.
